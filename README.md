# Snake Game

This is a classic Snake game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to control the snake and eat food to grow longer, while avoiding collisions with the walls and the snake's own body. As the snake eats more food, it moves faster and becomes more challenging.

## About

The Snake game is a well-known arcade game where the player controls a snake that grows longer with each piece of food it eats. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the walls. This project is a simple implementation of the game using modern web technologies: HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.

This project demonstrates the basic concepts of game development, such as game loops, collision detection, and handling user input.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The game adapts to different screen sizes for a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile.
- **Snake Movement:** The snake moves in four directions (up, down, left, and right).
- **Score Tracking:** The score is updated as the snake eats food, and the final score is displayed when the game ends.
- **Game Over Condition:** The game ends when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- **Difficulty Progression:** The snake's speed increases as it grows longer.
- **Real-time Rendering:** The game board and snake are updated in real-time using JavaScript.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for the game elements (canvas, buttons, etc.).
- **CSS**: Used for styling the game interface, ensuring it is visually appealing and responsive.
- **JavaScript**: Powers the game logic, including movement, collision detection, and score management.
  
## Game Instructions

1. **Start the Game**: Open the `index.html` file in your browser to play the game.
2. **Controls**: Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the movement of the snake.
3. **Goal**: Eat the food to grow the snake longer. Each piece of food adds to your score.
4. **Game Over**: The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.
5. **Restart**: After the game is over, click the "Restart" button to play again.

## How to Play

1. Launch the game by opening the `index.html` file in any modern browser (Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.).
2. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate the snake.
3. Eat the food (represented by a square) to increase your score and grow the snake.
4. Be careful not to hit the walls or collide with your own body, as that will result in the game ending.
5. As the snake eats more food, it will grow in size and increase in speed, making the game more challenging.
6. Once the game ends, you can restart it by clicking the "Restart" button.
